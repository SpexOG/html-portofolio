<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Sebastian Mutulescu, and I was born on August 9, 2001. I believe in
  astrology and I am a Leo. I am passionate about programming, especially Web
  Design. I am from Târgu Jiu, and currently, I am studying ETTI at the
  Polytechnic University of Bucharest. In my free time, I enjoy playing games
  like League of Legends, Counter-Strike, Dota, GTA, and Need for Speed. My
  favorite activities are: watching scientific documentaries, listening to
  podcasts, spending time with my friends, and being a huge fan of Hip-Hop
  culture.

  My favorite rappers are Nas, Big L, Gangstarr (Guru & DJ Premiere or Preemo),
  Biggie, DMX, ONYX, and of course, Wu-Tang. I am more oriented towards East
  Coast Hip-Hop culture, but I also enjoy some songs from West Coast artists
  like Tupac, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, Warren G, WC, and of course, Nate
  Dogg and Eminem.

  My love for this culture has led me to want to be a part of it, and
  considering that the Hip-Hop culture consists of 4 elements (DJ, MC, Graffer,
  and BBoy), I chose to pursue graffiti art. At the age of 14, I started
  sketching my first graffiti pieces, and by 15, I was already painting on the
  buildings of my hometown, representing and promoting the Hip-Hop culture.
  Later on, I met other graffiti artists, and we even painted on trains, and
  this movement has continued to this day. This is essentially my story up to
  this point – that's who I am!
